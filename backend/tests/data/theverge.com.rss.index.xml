They start at $6.99 per month for 20 pages’ worth of prints and whatever the current HP Envy model is, and go all the way up to a $35.99-a-month affair that gets you an OfficeJet Pro and 700 pages.

The permissions get asked for one by one as they’re needed, so you’ve got plenty of control over how your apps are behaving. </p> <p id="Lu961c">But sometimes, especially when you’re in a hurry, it’s easy to accidentally give permission for an app to access data it doesn’t really require.
